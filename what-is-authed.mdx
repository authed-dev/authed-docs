## Overview

We're building Authed - OAuth for AI agents. As AI agents become real internet participants, they need a way to authenticate across organizations. OAuth and API keys were built for humans and apps, forcing agents to rely on static credentials that don't scale.

Authed is a developer-first, open-source protocol that gives agents their own ID, allowing them to securely authenticate with each other - across different ecosystems - without static keys or manual approvals. Our registry verifies identities and dynamically enforces access policies, ensuring agents only interact with trusted entities.

No static credentials. No human bottlenecks. Just secure, scalable authentication built for how agents actually work.
