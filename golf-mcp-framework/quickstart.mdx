Let's get you started with your first GolfMCP project from scratch.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Pip (Python package installer)

### 1. Install GolfMCP

```bash
pip install golf-mcp
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Create a new GolfMCP project using the `init` command:

```bash
golf init my_awesome_server
cd my_awesome_server
```

This will create a new directory named `my_awesome_server` with the following structure:

```
my_awesome_server/
├── .env                  # Environment variables (e.g., API keys, secrets)
├── golf.json             # Main project configuration
├── pre_build.py          # Optional pre-build script (e.g., for auth setup)
├── prompts/              # Directory for prompt components
│   └── welcome.py
├── resources/            # Directory for resource components
│   ├── current_time.py
│   └── info.py
│   └── weather/
│       ├── common.py
│       ├── current.py
│       └── forecast.py
└── tools/                # Directory for tool components
    ├── github_user.py
    ├── hello.py
    └── payments/
        ├── charge.py
        ├── common.py
        └── refund.py
```

*   **`golf.json`**: Configures your server's name, port, transport, etc.
*   **`.env`**: Stores environment-specific variables (automatically created).
*   **`tools/`**, **`resources/`**, **`prompts/`**: Directories where you'll define your server's capabilities.
*   **`pre_build.py`**: An optional script for custom logic before building, often used for authentication setup.

### 3. Create Your First Tool

Let's modify the example "hello" tool. Open `tools/hello.py`:

```python
'''Hello World tool for {{project_name}}.'''

from pydantic import BaseModel

# Defines the expected output structure for this tool
class Output(BaseModel):
    '''Response from the hello tool.'''
    message: str

# This is the main function for the tool
async def say_hello(
    name: str = "World",
    greeting: str = "Hello"
) -> Output:
    '''Say hello to the given name.

    This is a simple example tool that demonstrates the basic structure
    of a tool implementation in GolfMCP.
    '''
    response_message = f"{greeting}, {name}! Welcome to GolfMCP!"
    print(f"Tool 'say_hello' called with: name='{name}', greeting='{greeting}'")
    return Output(message=response_message)

# The 'export' variable tells GolfMCP which function is the entry point for this tool
export = say_hello
```

We've updated the greeting message and changed the function name to `say_hello`. The `export = say_hello` line is crucial as it tells Golf which function to expose as the tool.

### 4. Build for Development

Compile your project for development:

```bash
golf build dev
```

This command:
*   Parses your project files.
*   Transforms them into a FastMCP server structure.
*   Creates a `dist/` directory containing the runnable server (`server.py`) and any necessary supporting files (like auth components).
*   For `dev` builds, it copies your `.env` file to the `dist/` directory, making environment variables available to the server.

### 5. Run Your Server

Execute the built server:

```bash
golf run
```

Congratulations! You've built and run your first GolfMCP server.
