## Installation

Install the Authed CLI tools using pip:

```bash
pip install agent-auth
```

## Quick Start

The Authed CLI provides tools to manage your authentication system. Most commands support two modes:
- **Interactive mode** (recommended): Guides you through options with helpful prompts
- **Direct mode**: Useful for scripts and automation

### Initial Setup

Sets up your CLI with authentication details. This is the first step to start using Authed.

Interactive (recommended):
```bash
agent-auth init config
```
This will prompt you for:
- Registry URL: Where your authentication service is hosted
- Provider ID: Your unique provider identifier
- Provider Secret: Your provider's secret key

Direct command:
```bash
agent-auth init config --registry-url <REGISTRY_URL> --provider-id <PROVIDER_ID> --provider-secret <PROVIDER_SECRET>
```

### Agent Management

Agents are the core of Authed - they represent services or applications that need to communicate securely.

Create agent (creates a new service identity):
```bash
agent-auth agents create
```
The CLI will guide you through:
- Provider ID: Who owns this agent
- Agent name: A friendly name for your service
- Key file options: Where to store authentication keys

Direct command:
```bash
agent-auth agents create --provider-id <PROVIDER_ID> --name <AGENT_NAME>
```

List all agents (see all your services):
```bash
agent-auth agents list
```

Get agent info (view details about a specific service):
```bash
agent-auth agents info
```
You'll be prompted for the agent ID, or use direct:
```bash
agent-auth agents info <AGENT_ID>
```

### Key Management

Manage cryptographic keys used for secure authentication between agents.

Generate keys (create new authentication keys):
```bash
agent-auth keys generate
```
You'll be asked for the output location, or use direct:
```bash
agent-auth keys generate --output <FILE_PATH>
```

View public key (safely share this with other services):
```bash
agent-auth keys show-public
```
You'll be prompted for the key file, or use direct:
```bash
agent-auth keys show-public <KEY_FILE>
```

### Permissions

Control what your agents can access and do.

List permissions (see what an agent can access):
```bash
agent-auth permissions list
```
You'll be prompted for:
- Agent ID: Which agent to check
- Output file: Where to save the permissions list (optional)

Direct command:
```bash
agent-auth permissions list <AGENT_ID> [--output <FILE>]
```

Clear permissions (reset agent access):
```bash
agent-auth permissions clear
```
You'll be asked to confirm the action, or use direct:
```bash
agent-auth permissions clear <AGENT_ID> --force
```

### Logs

Monitor and debug your authentication system.

View logs (see authentication activity):
```bash
agent-auth logs fetch
```
You'll be prompted for:
- Agent ID: Which agent to check
- Log level: How detailed (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Number of logs: How many to fetch
- Output file: Where to save logs

Direct command:
```bash
agent-auth logs fetch --agent-id <AGENT_ID> --level ERROR --limit 10
```

Stream logs (watch authentication activity in real-time):
```bash
agent-auth logs stream
```
You'll be prompted for filtering options, or use direct:
```bash
agent-auth logs stream --agent-id <AGENT_ID>
```

## Environment Variables

Make your scripts easier by setting these environment variables instead of passing them in every command:

```bash
export AGENT_AUTH_REGISTRY_URL="https://registry.authed.com"
export AGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER_ID="your_provider_id"
export AGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER_SECRET="your_provider_secret"
```

## Common Workflows

### Setting Up a New Agent

Here's how to create a new service that can authenticate with others:

Interactive (recommended):
```bash
# Generate keys with prompts - creates secure authentication keys
agent-auth keys generate

# Create agent with guided setup - registers your service
agent-auth agents create
```

Direct commands:
```bash
# Generate keys
agent-auth keys generate --output agent-keys.json

# Create agent
agent-auth agents create --provider-id my-provider --name worker-1 --key-file agent-keys.json
```

### Monitoring Events

Keep track of your authentication system:

Interactive:
```bash
# View logs with filtering options
agent-auth logs fetch
```

Direct:
```bash
# View recent errors
agent-auth logs fetch --level ERROR --limit 10

# Export to file for analysis
agent-auth logs fetch --from-date 2024-01-01 --output logs.json
```

## Best Practices

1. Use interactive mode when getting started - it's more helpful and prevents mistakes
2. Switch to direct commands for automation and scripts
3. Use descriptive agent names to easily identify services
4. Regularly rotate agent keys to maintain security
5. Monitor authentication logs to catch issues early
