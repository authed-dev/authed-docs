# Product overview

Golf provides a seamless, self-hosted gateway solution for integrating and orchestrating MCP (Model Context Protocol) interactions between your applications and backend AI model services. As AI agents become the dominant interface for applications, having a reliable, secure, and observable MCP server becomes essential.

## What Golf MCP Gateway does

### Session management

Golf MCP Gateway delivers robust session management capabilities that ensure each client interaction remains isolated and secure. Our system maintains persistent session tracking backed by Redis, allowing for reliable state management even through service restarts or network interruptions. The gateway handles the entire session lifecycle transparently, freeing your developers from implementing complex session handling logic.

### Supported transports

Golf MCP Gateway supports both legacy and current MCP specifications for maximum compatibility:

- **Streamable HTTP (Current MCP spec)** - Full support for the latest MCP specification with streamable HTTP, providing improved performance and reliability
- **HTTP+SSE (legacy)** - Support for the original MCP specification using HTTP and Server-Sent Events, ensuring compatibility with existing clients and implementations

This dual support helps create a smooth migration path while allowing you to take advantage of the latest MCP features.

### Deployment overview

Golf MCP Gateway is designed for flexible deployment in modern infrastructure environments:

- **Redis** - For reliable session persistence and state management
- **Lightweight Docker container** - Minimizes resource requirements while maintaining high performance

### Customizable endpoint

Deploy the MCP Gateway on your own domain (e.g., `mcp.yourdomain.com`) for a seamless customer experience. This approach allows you to maintain your brand identity while leveraging our powerful gateway infrastructure. The customizable endpoint integrates smoothly with your existing systems and security policies, providing flexibility without compromising on control.

### Authentication and authorization

Golf MCP Gateway integrates smoothly with your existing authentication and authorization mechanisms, minimizing overhead and enabling seamless adoption:

- **API Key Passthrough**:  
  If your clients already have API keys, they can seamlessly pass these keys directly as parameters within MCP calls. The Golf Gateway transparently forwards these keys, allowing your existing backend services to handle authentication without interruption or additional complexity.

- **OAuth Integration**:  
  For clients with existing OAuth authentication flows, the Golf Gateway integrates directly with your OAuth provider. We proactively assist you in integrating your MCP server into your existing OAuth flow, ensuring secure and transparent authentication for MCP interactions, leveraging your established authorization infrastructure for managing permissions and access control.

## What clients see

From the client perspective, Golf MCP Gateway provides a persistent, reliable connection with zero session management complexity. Clients establish a simple connection once, and the gateway handles all the complex aspects. If a connection to the MCP server drops, the gateway automatically reconnects to a new server instance, saving the current state. Client sessions persist even through MCP server crashes.

## What you get

### Monitoring

Gain real-time visibility into your MCP interactions through comprehensive Prometheus-compatible metrics and structured logging. The gateway provides detailed information about connection rates, message throughput, error patterns, and latency metrics. This observability allows you to proactively identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure reliable service delivery to your clients.

### Usage tracking

Understand how clients interact with your MCP services through detailed analytics. The gateway tracks usage patterns across different clients, endpoints, and time periods, giving you actionable insights into service utilization.

### Billing integration

The gateway includes built-in monetization features that make it easy to implement usage-based pricing for your MCP services. Detailed consumption tracking captures the metrics most relevant to your business model, whether that's request counts, bandwidth usage, or custom transaction types. This data integrates with your billing systems to enable transparent, accurate invoicing for your services.

### Custom rate limits

Protect your backend services and ensure fair usage with configurable client-specific rate limiting. The gateway allows you to define and enforce different limits for different clients or tiers of service, preventing any single client from monopolizing resources. These limits can be adjusted dynamically, allowing you to respond to changing usage patterns or business requirements without disrupting service.

## Why Golf MCP Gateway?

### Simplicity

Golf MCP Gateway abstracts away the complex details of protocol handling and session orchestration, allowing your team to focus on building valuable features rather than infrastructure. This simplification enables faster integration with existing systems and reduces the learning curve for developers working with MCP services.

### Robustness

The gateway ensures reliable communication with backend AI services by implementing best practices for error handling, retry logic, and connection management. This robustness minimizes downtime and service interruptions, even in challenging network conditions. The system is designed to recover gracefully from failures, maintaining session state and reconnecting clients automatically whenever possible.

### Scalability

As your user base grows, Golf MCP Gateway scales effortlessly to handle increased demand. The architecture supports dynamic scaling without requiring changes to your application code or client implementations. Whether you're serving a handful of enterprise clients or millions of consumers, the gateway adjusts to your needs, ensuring consistent performance and reliability throughout your growth journey.
