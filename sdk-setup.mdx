## Installation

Install the Authed SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install authed
```

## Basic setup

The easiest way to get started is to use our `authed init setup` command, which offers two modes:

### 1. Unclaimed Provider (Limited Capabilities)

```bash
authed init setup
```

This will:
- Create a new unclaimed provider
- Set up a default agent
- Generate a secure key pair in PEM format
- Create `.env` with all credentials properly formatted
- Limited to 3 agents, no logs
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` automatically

### 2. Claimed Provider (Full Capabilities)

```bash
authed init setup --provider-id "your-id" --provider-secret "your-secret"
```

This will:
- Use your existing claimed provider
- Set up a default agent
- Validate existing key pair or generate new one if needed
- Update `.env` with all credentials in proper format
- Enable full capabilities (unlimited agents, logs)

### Claiming a Provider

To get full capabilities:
1. Visit [getauthed.dev](https://getauthed.dev/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Follow the onboarding process to claim your provider
4. Use the provided credentials with `authed init setup`

Once claimed, your provider gains:
- Unlimited agent creation
- Access to logs and analytics
- Advanced management features

### Initialize the SDK

After running the setup command, you can initialize the SDK using environment variables:

```python
from authed import Authed

# Initialize from environment variables (recommended)
auth = Authed.from_env()
```

If you need more control, you can also initialize explicitly:

```python
# Initialize with explicit credentials
auth = Authed.initialize(
    registry_url="https://api.getauthed.dev",
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    agent_secret="your-agent-secret",
    private_key="your-private-key",
    public_key="your-public-key"
)
```

### Environment Variables

The SDK uses these environment variables (automatically configured by `authed init setup`):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AUTHED_REGISTRY_URL` | Yes | Registry URL |
| `AUTHED_PROVIDER_ID` | Yes | Provider ID |
| `AUTHED_PROVIDER_SECRET` | Yes | Provider secret |
| `AUTHED_AGENT_ID` | For outgoing | Agent ID for requests |
| `AUTHED_AGENT_SECRET` | For outgoing | Agent secret |
| `AUTHED_PRIVATE_KEY` | For outgoing | Private key for signing |
| `AUTHED_PUBLIC_KEY` | For incoming | Public key for verification |

The command automatically:
- Validates key pairs for proper PEM format and headers/footers
- Ensures proper quoting of environment variables in `.env`
- Preserves existing environment variables not related to Authed

## Request authentication

### Protecting incoming requests

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from authed import verify_fastapi

app = FastAPI()

# Required authentication
@app.get("/protected")
@verify_fastapi
async def protected_endpoint(request: Request):
    return {"message": "This endpoint requires authentication"}
```

### Making authenticated requests

```python
from authed import protect_httpx, protect_requests
import httpx
import requests

# Using HTTPX (async)
@protect_httpx()
async def make_authenticated_request():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        # The decorator automatically adds auth headers
        response = await client.get(
            "https://api.example.com/some-endpoint",
            headers={"target-agent-id": "target-agent-uuid"}
        )
        return response.json()

# Using requests (sync)
@protect_requests()
def make_sync_request():
    with requests.Session() as session:
        # The decorator automatically adds auth headers
        response = session.get(
            "https://api.example.com/some-endpoint",
            headers={"target-agent-id": "target-agent-uuid"}
        )
        return response.json()
```

### Combined example

```python
@app.get("/chain-request")
@verify_fastapi  # Verify incoming requests
@protect_httpx()   # Protect outgoing requests
async def chain_request(request: Request):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(
            "https://api.example.com/another-service",
            headers={"target-agent-id": "target-agent-uuid"}
        )
        return {
            "incoming_auth": "valid",
            "outgoing_response": response.json()
        }
```

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Security recommendations">
    1. Always use HTTPS in production environments
    2. Store agent credentials securely
    3. Rotate agent credentials regularly
    4. Monitor authentication events using the logging system
    5. Use agent or provider IDs in permissions
