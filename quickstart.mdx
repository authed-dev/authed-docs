<Note>
  While authed is open source, we are currently only support our hosted registry (https://api.getauthed.dev). Self-hosting registries is possible but not officially supported or documented yet.
</Note>

## Getting started

Get up and running with Authed in just two simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install authed
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Your First Agent">
    ```bash
    authed init setup
    ```
    
    Or with a claimed provider:
    ```bash
    authed init setup --provider-id "your-provider-id" --provider-secret "your-provider-secret"
    ```
    
    This command will:
    - Create a new unclaimed provider (or use existing credentials)
    - Set up a default agent
    - Generate a secure key pair
    - Create .env with all required configuration including provider ID and secret
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You're ready to use Authed in your applications.

## Basic integration

Here's a minimal example using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from authed import Authed, verify_fastapi, protect_httpx
import httpx

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize Authed from environment variables (configured by `authed init setup`)
auth = Authed.from_env()

# Protected endpoint
@app.post("/secure-endpoint")
@verify_fastapi
async def secure_endpoint(request: Request):
    return {"message": "Authenticated!"}

# Making authenticated requests
@app.get("/call-other-agent")
@protect_httpx()
async def call_other_agent():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "http://other-agent/secure-endpoint",
            headers={"target-agent-id": "target-agent-uuid"},
            json={"message": "Hello!"}
        )
    return response.json()
```

<Note>
  For brevity, this example shows keys as strings. In practice, you should load them from your environment or key files.
</Note>

The `authed init setup` command will automatically configure your environment variables, but here's what gets set up:

```bash
# Registry and provider configuration
AUTHED_REGISTRY_URL="https://api.getauthed.dev"
AUTHED_PROVIDER_ID="your-provider-id"
AUTHED_PROVIDER_SECRET="your-provider-secret"

# Agent configuration
AUTHED_AGENT_ID="your-agent-id"
AUTHED_AGENT_SECRET="your-agent-secret"

# Keys for signing and verifying requests
AUTHED_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
AUTHED_PUBLIC_KEY="your-public-key"
```

  Remember to never commit agent secrets or provider credentials to version control.
  Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions in production.
